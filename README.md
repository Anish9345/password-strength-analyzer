# 🔐 Password Strength Analyzer

A simple and effective tool that evaluates the strength of a password based on common security best practices.  
This project is designed for **educational and security awareness purposes**, especially for beginners in **Cyber Security**.

## 📌 Features

The tool checks a password against the following criteria:

- ✅ Minimum length requirement

- 🔡 Presence of **lowercase letters (a–z)**  
- 🔢 Presence of **numbers (0–9)**  
- 🔣 Presence of **special characters** (`@, #, $, %, !`, etc.)

Based on these checks, the password is classified as:

- ❌ **Weak**
- ⚠️ **Medium**
- ✅ **Strong**
